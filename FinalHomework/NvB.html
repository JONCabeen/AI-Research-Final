        <p style="text-align: center;">Narrow Vs. Broad A.I.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Or is it "Narrow Vs. General" A.I.? Since that's what comes up on every other source when I Google "Narrow Vs. Broad." I'm going to continue this report assuming they're two of the same.</p>

        <p>"What is my purpose?" Narrow A.I. Is here to serve you, and has been for sometime already. Algorithms that personalizes everyday software use. A good example would be your YouTube recommendations. Software developed over years that takes what you enjoy seeing and keeps the front page of YouTube fresh for you, sometimes even putting the exact video you were just thinking about right in the front for you. Other examples would include voice assistance such as Siri, Alexa, or even Bixby that search the web for you or help use your phone while you're driving. Narrow A.I. is accessible and affordable to have in consumer electronics and software.</p>

        <p>General A.I. bares an uncanny resemblance to the way a human would think. Except faster. Almost instant in some cases. And without those pesky emotions getting in the way. General A.I.s are fed a wealth of knowledge humans are capable of having, and can use that knowledge to conquer many problems thrown at them, meaning a general A.I. with a voice could participate in an intelligent conversation comparable to a talk you'd have with a friend. This type of A.I. is uncommon at a consumer level currently, but will sneak it's way into our everyday lives eventually and sooner rather than later.</p>
