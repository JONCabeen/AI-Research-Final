       <p style="text-align: center;">Generative A.I. is the type of A.I. that has taken center stage this past couple of years. Everything from Outlook predicting what you're going to say in an eMail, to those uncanny pictures and animations you see online now. Generative A.I. is very controversial because it requires learning from existing works to create it's own, often putting it in plagiarism category. A.I. art can look cool at a quick glance. After all, it has been taught proven methods of color pallets and composition, but there's no intent behind it. There's no emotion, or statement being made. It was just prompted with an idea and manufactured something based on what it knows. It can't be compared to something made by a person, there is no "art" only product. Despite that, however, it's a modern marvel, and A.I. gnerated content is actually greatly useful and welcomed in the right context.</p>
