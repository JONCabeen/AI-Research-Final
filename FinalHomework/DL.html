       <p style="text-align: center;">Deep Learning is Machine Learning without metaphorical training wheels. No longer are scientist spending hundreds of collective hours meticulously teaching an A.I., with Deep Learning, the A.I. is now recognizes patterns on it's own and is given definitions and conclusions to things it must know. While Deep Learning can't be reached without months of Machine Learning, once it has been achieved, an A.I. can learn and evolve at an exponential rate. This includes robots freed from the constrains of the internet and supercomputers and can roam to understand the physical realm. </p>
